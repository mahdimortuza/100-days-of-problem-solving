# 100-days-of-problem-solving

- Today is my birthday and I am starting this challenge. Hopefully I can complete the challenge.
- I will use my favorite language JavaScript to complete this.
- Any project development won't be included in this challenge. I am just focusing on data structure and algorithmic problems.
- I will dive deep on data structure and algorithm as I have lack of knowledge on these topics.
- For finding problems I will use different problem solving websites.
- I am setting 10 milestones for this and I will set the name and goal before starting it.
- I will include everyday learning track on their markdown file.
